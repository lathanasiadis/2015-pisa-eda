Exploratory Data Analysis of the 2015 PISA results, using `data.table` and `ggplot2`.

In the PISA study, students were tested in three disciplines:
- Math
- Reading
- Science

Results for male and female students are logged separetely in the dataset.

I examined the following factors to conclude whether they affected the students' performance:
- Country
- Region (as defined by the World Bank)
- EU membership
- Gender

Developed for my "Programming Tools for Data Science" graduate class.
